      <description>Over my career, I have performed in Data Engineering, Analytic, and Science roles. One consistent focus of mine has been working with external and internal customers to help identify opportunities to more effectively work with data in support of business goals. This has ranged from building automated data pipelines, building out self-service analytics platforms, supporting the construction and deployment of machine learning models, to helping optimize IT infrastructure to better serve an analytic team.</description>

      <description>Preface Before I talk about my views on ethics in the realm of Data Science, I first want to talk about how I got into Data Science. I spent the first two years of my career doing some analysis accompanied by mostly Data Engineering before I knew it was Data Engineering. At this two year mark in 2014, I was at a point where I wanted to figure out where I wanted to take my career next.</description>

      <description> Ethical use of algorithms with data  Duration: ~30 minutes In this talk, I discuss my journey into data science and how I discovered the importance of keeping ethics in mind when building models or collecting data. There is both a high potential for good and harm to both individuals and entire communities.
