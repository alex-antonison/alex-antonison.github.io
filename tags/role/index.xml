      <description>Working in data In my experience, working in data can at times be a bit confusing and overwhelming because of the sheer breadth of skills and techniques that are needed to process, manage, and analyze data. In this post, I am going to work to group these sets of skills into different roles and highlight my personal opinion of what order a company should build out each group as well as emphasize on it is not realistic to do more than one role at once.</description>
